Binding to OpenAL.

This library tries to be as close to original API as possible, while using
Ada types whenever possible. It is under ISC license. Full list of authors
is in AUTHORS file.

Use gprbuild for building (building with gnatmake is not tested).
This projects depends on OpenAL and ALUT (on Debian-like operating system these
dependencies can be satisfied by installing libopenal-dev and libalut-dev
packages).

When linking against Oto don't forget to add "-lalut" and "-lopenal" to your's
linker switches.

To build with different than default CPU switches add "-XCPU=switches" to
gprbuild command. Defualt CPU switches are: "-march=native -fPIC"

[Incomplete] Binding to OpenAL.

This library tries to be as close to original API as possible, while using
Ada types whenever possible. It is under GMGPL license. Full list of authors
is in AUTHORS file.

Use gprbuild for building. Gnatmake may work but is not supported (and is
deprecated).

When linking against Oto don't forget to add "-lalut" and "-lopenal" to your's
linker switches.

To build with different than default CPU switches add "-XCPU=switches" to
gprbuild command. Defualt CPU switches are: "-m64 -mssse3 -march=native -fPIC"
